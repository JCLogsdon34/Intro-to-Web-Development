    <H1> Formatting Page Demo </h1>
        <body>
           <p> This simple page demonstrates the formatting tags covered in this lesson. </p>
    <h2>Bold and Strong</h2>
        <dl>
           <dt>Bold:</dt>
              <dd> <b> Bold: This is bold text </b> </dd>     
        </dl>
          <p> The strong tag has the same visual effect as the bold tag but the 
          strong tag also marks the enclosed text as more important. 
          It is also easier for screen readers to read for the visually disabled.
          </p>
        <dl>

            <dd><i> This text is in italics </i> </dd>
        </dl>
        <p> The emphasis tag has the same visual effect as the italic tag but the emphasis tag also
            marks the enclosed text as more important. 
            It is also easier for screen readers to read.
        </p>
